## How it works
This project generates two sinusoidal waveforms with a fixed 90° phase offset (I/Q signals) using Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) techniques.
The output is presented on output in Pulse Code Modulation via two first order Sigma-Delta modulators.
DSS block can be prescaled by sending the prescaler value through SPI port.

Oscillator design is based on the following paper:
[J. Nam, A Study of Sinusoid Generation Using Recursive Algorithms](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~juhan/pubs/jnam-emile05.pdf)

### PINPUT
Inputs:
- `spi_clk = uo_in[0]`
- `spi_cs = uo_in[1]`
- `spi_miso = uo_in[2]`

Outputs:
- `pcm_sin = uo_out[0]`
- `pcm_sin_n = uo_out[1]`
- `pcm_cos = uo_out[2]`
- `pcm_cos_n = uo_out[3]`

## How to test
### Basic test
 - Reset device by putting `rst_n = 0` while providing a clock signal cycle on `clk` pin.
 - While keeping `spi_cs = 0` provide 50MHz clock to `clk` pin, a 1kHz PCM sine and cosine signal should be visible respectively on `pcm_sin` and `pcm_cos` pins.
 - `pcm_sin_n` and `pcm_cos_n` pins are the negated counterparts.
### Full test
- Buffer the outputs `pcm_sin`, `pcm_cos`, `pcm_sin_n` and `pcm_cos_n` with for example a 74AC244 Digital buffer IC and filter them with a RC filter (suggested cutoff frequecy 50-100 kHz range).
- Observe sine and cosine analog outputs.
- Using SPI port, the prescaler `pre[15:0]` cane be loaded with new value allowing for output signals frequency control. After reset prescaler default value is `0x0124` corresponding to 1kHz. In general output frequency is given by rougthly `f_sig = f_clk / pre[15:0] / 400`
